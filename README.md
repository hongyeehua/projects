Hello! Welcome to Hong Yee (Isaac)'s project repository.

This is a portfolio of current projects that I am working on, in addition to other projects that I have completed before.

- 🇲🇾🚗 Malaysia_GST_Automobiles is an extended essay that I completed in late 2019. I conducted an economical analysis with Excel to investigate 
the impact of Malaysia's changing tax regimes on Kuala Lumpur's automobile industry. I extracted and analysed data from Paultan.org
- 🏀🔥 Basketball_Success is a self-researched report that I completed in 2019. I gathered primary data from my individual statistics, 
in combination with data from basketball players in my school to investigate the "hot hand" phenomenon in basketball culture. I complemented my studies with
secondary data from NBA basketball players to test my hypotheses.
- 🌱🧍 Human_Plant_Damage is a self-researched report that I completed in 2019. Using Spearman's rank correlation test and hypothesis testing, I evaluated the
literature and the intuition that human interference of any kind introduces negative effects on nature's vegetation.
