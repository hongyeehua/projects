Hello! Welcome to Hong Yee (Isaac)'s project repository.
This is a portfolio of current projects that I am working on, in addition to other projects that I have completed before.

- 📈📉 Company_Stock_Market_Sentiment is a project/tool in Python that I completed in 2023. Using Newspaper, NLTK, Cohere and Alpha Vantage as natural language processing tools, I created a current market sentiment analysis programme that outputs the most relevant and current news of a company, along with a market sentiment score.

- 🚇🚋 TTC_Regression_Report is a research report that I completed in 2022. I analysed the Toronto Transit Commission's weekday daily ridership, producing a multiple linear regression model that predicts the number of TTC riders on an average weekday, given figures for employment rates, temperature, rainfall, relative humidity, gas prices, visibility.

- 🇲🇾🚗 Malaysia_GST_Automobiles is an extended essay that I completed in late 2019. I conducted an economical analysis with Excel to investigate 
the impact of Malaysia's changing tax regimes on Kuala Lumpur's automobile industry.

- 🏀🔥 Basketball_Success is a self-researched report that I completed in 2019. I gathered primary data from my individual statistics, 
in combination with data from basketball players in my school to investigate the "hot hand" phenomenon in basketball culture. 
I complemented my studies with secondary data from NBA basketball players to test my hypotheses.

- 🌱🧍 Human_Plant_Damage is a self-researched report that I completed in 2019. Using Spearman's rank correlation test and hypothesis testing, I evaluated the literature and the intuition that human interference of any kind introduces negative effects on nature's vegetation.
